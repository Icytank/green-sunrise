## Executive Summary

GREEN SUNRISE LTD is a specialized Bulgarian construction and installation company dedicated to the photovoltaic (PV) power plant sector. The project involves creating a high-performance, bilingual (Bulgarian/English) portfolio website using Astro and Cloudflare. The site serves as a professional showcase of the company's technical capacity—specifically its ownership of specialized pile-driving machinery and experienced teams—targeting EPC contractors and renewable energy investors across Bulgaria and Europe.

## Core Vision

### Problem Statement

The rapidly growing PV construction market in Bulgaria and Europe often faces challenges with contractor reliability, lack of technical precision, and poor on-site coordination. Investors and EPC companies need specialized partners who can guarantee adherence to strict technical standards and timelines without the logistical delays often caused by rented equipment or outsourced, untrained labor.

### Problem Impact

Unreliable installation partners lead to project delays, increased costs, and potential long-term efficiency losses for PV power plants. For investors, this represents a significant financial risk and a barrier to scaling the transition to sustainable energy.

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

General construction companies lack the deep specialization required for PV infrastructures, particularly in precise pile-driving and module positioning across diverse terrains. Many existing subcontractors rely on rented machinery (causing scheduling conflicts) and lack a professional digital presence that signals their readiness for large-scale or international partnerships.

### Proposed Solution

A premium, localized portfolio website built with Astro for maximum speed and SEO efficiency. The site will clearly communicate GREEN SUNRISE LTD's "all-in-house" advantage—owning their own pile-driving equipment and employing trained professional teams—to establish immediate technical authority and trust with B2B partners.

### Key Differentiators

*   **Technological Resourcefulness:** Directly owned specialized pile-driving machinery ensuring scheduling stability and execution precision.
*   **Specialized Expertise:** 100% focus on PV infrastructure, rather than general construction.
*   **Bilingual Readiness:** Bulgarian and English support to facilitate partnerships with international investors and European EPC firms.
*   **Flexibility:** Capability to act as a full-stage partner or a specialized subcontractor for specific installation phases.
*   **Terrain Mastery:** Proven ability to handle installation across various and challenging terrains.

## Target Users

### Primary Users

#### 1. The Project Lead (EPC & Development)
*   **Context:** Works for a large engineering or development firm responsible for delivering a utility-scale PV plant.
*   **Problem:** They are under immense pressure to hit strict deadlines. Their biggest fear is a subcontractor who lacks the machinery or skilled labor to keep up with the main construction schedule.
*   **Success Vision:** Finding a partner like GREEN SUNRISE LTD that owns their own pile-drivers—this signals stability and guaranteed availability. They see the "Projects" page and immediately feel confident that "if they did it for these 8 sites, they can do it for mine."

#### 2. The Strategic Investor
*   **Context:** An individual or firm investing in the Bulgarian or European energy transition.
*   **Problem:** They need high-quality execution to ensure the long-term ROI of the solar plant. They worry about "shoddy" installation that leads to maintenance issues later.
*   **Success Vision:** They are looking for the "Trusted Partner" vibe. The bilingual site and professional "About Us" section signal that this is a company capable of international-standard collaboration.

### Secondary Users

#### Technical Auditors & Local Partners
*   **Context:** Professionals responsible for verifying technical standards on-site.
*   **Role:** They visit the site to check specific service capabilities (like pile-driving precision) or to find contact details for site-specific coordination.

### User Journey

1.  **Discovery:** The user finds the site via a professional recommendation, LinkedIn, or a B2B search for "PV installation Bulgaria."
2.  **Validation (Homepage):** They land on the Homepage and immediately see "Owned pile-driving equipment" and "Bulgarian/English" support. This passes their "initial sniff test."
3.  **The Deep Dive (Services):** They move to Services to confirm the exact technical scope (e.g., Do they do module installation too? Yes.).
4.  **The "Aha!" Moment (Projects):** They click into the Projects gallery. Seeing the 8 completed plants with MW capacity and clear photos is the final proof they need to trust the company.
5.  **Conversion (Contact):** They reach out via the Contact page to request a partnership or inquiry, knowing they are talking to experts.

## Success Metrics

### User Success Outcomes
*   **Proof of Work Validation:** Users (EPCs/Investors) successfully find the project capacity and location data they need to justify a partnership. Success is when a user navigates from a specific service detail directly to the relevant project proof.
*   **Information Accessibility:** International partners can navigate the entire portfolio in English without friction, establishing instant professional credibility.

### Business Objectives
*   **Professional Identity (0-3 Months):** Establish a state-of-the-art digital presence that differentiates GREEN SUNRISE LTD from smaller, less-equipped subcontractors via technical showcase (owned machinery focus).
*   **International Reach:** Attract interest from non-Bulgarian EPC firms and investors looking for reliable local installation partners.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
*   **KPI 1: Contact Form Submissions:** The primary metric—direct inquiries regarding partnerships or specific PV projects.
*   **KPI 2: Project Engagement Depth:** Percentage of visitors who view at least 3 items in the Projects gallery, indicating high trust-building activity.
*   **KPI 3: Language Toggle Usage:** Tracking the volume of English vs. Bulgarian sessions to measure international interest.
*   **KPI 4: Page Speed/Core Web Vitals:** Ensuring the Astro/Cloudflare stack maintains <1s load times to project technical excellence.

## MVP Scope

### Core Features
*   **Five Pillar Pages:** High-performance Home, About Us, Services, Projects, and Contact pages.
*   **Bilingual Infrastructure:** Seamless English and Bulgarian localization support for all content.
*   **Project Showcase Gallery:** A structured gallery highlighting the first 8 completed PV projects (Capacity, Scope, Timeline, Images).
*   **Technical Differentiator Showcase:** Prominent placement of technical assets like owned pile-driving machinery and professional teams.
*   **B2B Conversion Point:** Functional contact form for inquiries, partnerships, and EPC documentation requests.

### Out of Scope for MVP
*   **Interactive Calculators:** No dynamic solar yield or ROI calculators.
*   **Client/Partner Portal:** No authenticated dashboard or document management system.
*   **Dynamic News/Blog:** No regularly updated blogging or news publishing capabilities.
*   **Real-time Monitoring:** No integration with PV plant monitoring APIs or SCADA systems.

### MVP Success Criteria
