## The Challenge

The client needed a large-scale solar installation in Plovdiv's flat industrial zone, capable of providing stable power supply for manufacturing facilities. The main challenge was integration with the local power distribution network while maintaining high efficiency.

## Technical Scope

- **Installed Capacity:** 10.5 MW DC
- **Area:** 15 hectares
- **Panels:** 24,000+ high-efficiency monocrystalline modules
- **Inverters:** Central inverters with 98.5% efficiency
- **Monitoring:** 24/7 SCADA system with remote access

### Special Solutions

Implementation of tracking systems to optimize yield throughout the year. Integration with an automated panel cleaning system.

## The Outcome

The project was completed within 8 months and exceeded performance expectations by 12%. Annual production reaches 14.7 GWh, providing clean energy for over 4,000 households.
